This is a demo of a Laravel application deployed as a serverless application on AWS Lambda using [Bref](https://github.com/brefphp/bref).

**Please open issues in the [official repository](https://github.com/brefphp/bref)**, issues are disabled in this repository.

**This demo currently uses Serverless instead of SAM to configure and deploy the application**. This is because we are planning on migrating to Serverless, this repository has been updated in advance and reflects the future version of Bref.

The application is deployed at the following URL: https://8aj5cc6cc2.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev

If you want to learn more read the [Laravel guide in the Bref documentation](https://bref.sh/docs/frameworks/laravel.html).
